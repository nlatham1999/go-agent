- Make it so that the Api html generation isn't the ugliest code to ever exist
- switch the breedname string params to be the turtlebreed and linkbreed types

    - this should instead be a seperate package on top
    - collision detection layer they can add on
- patches, turtles "own" should be renamed to "properties"
- there should be a way to pass in the mouse x and y, maybe as a dynamic variable?
- build widgets in js
-  implement subtract-headings
- implement dx and dy
- make sure that distance works with wrap around on the horizontal
