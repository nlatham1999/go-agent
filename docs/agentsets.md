# AgentSets

An agent set is a set of [agents](./agents.md) and is the main way of interacting with groups of agents within go agent

There are three types of agent sets within go agent, for each type of agent: [LinkAgentSet](./linkagentset.md), [PatchAgentSet](./patchagentset.md), [TurtleAgentSet](./turtleagentset.md)

AgentSets are a wrapper on [sortedset](https://github.com/nlatham1999/sortedset)

Each value in an AgentSet is unique
