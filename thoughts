should there be a specific agentset type?

this would store the positions of each turtle so we can do list operations really fast

where should n-of functions be placed? At the model level? General (util) level? Or the Agentset level

AtPoints will always be use absolute coordinates since the caller will always be the observer

what if we stored the neighbors as pointers in each Patch

patch coordinates store the middle of the patch
 - minp(x)(y)cor being -15 means that the min coord is -15.5
 - maxp(x)(y)cor being 15 means that the max coord is 15.5
 - each patch goes +- .5

A turtles own variable for a breed has precedence over the general turtles own
for example if there is a starting variable of x = 30 for general and x = "test" for ants, a turtle of ants will have x = "test"

when changing the breed should the turtles own change?
